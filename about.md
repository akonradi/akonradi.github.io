I'm a software developer with too much time and a niggling urge to make stuff.
This blog was started as a place to document my personal projects (so I don't
end up 20 years later wondering why I did what I did). It's now, apparently,
expanded to include some of my musings on writing in Rust.
Hopefully you find it amusing and maybe a little bit helpful.
